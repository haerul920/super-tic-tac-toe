## üéÆ How to Play

The rules are simple, but the strategy is deep.

1.  **Main Goal**: Win **3 small boards** in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the main board to be the winner.
2.  **The Key Rule**: The square you play in on a small board **determines** which small board your opponent must play on next.
    -   *Example*: If you play in the **top-right square** of a small board, your opponent must then play on the **top-right small board**.
3.  **Free Board**: If the target small board has already been won or is full, your opponent is free to play on any open small board.
